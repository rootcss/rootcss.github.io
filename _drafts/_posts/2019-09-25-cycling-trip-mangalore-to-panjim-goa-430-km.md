I often open up the Google Maps, and search for the places/routes to visit next. This route has always been in my mind. This route consisted of many good places I always liked, plus, our Bangalore-Sakleshpur-Chikamangalur trip had the Mangalore highway in 70% of the trip; which always kept me keen to go till Mangalore.

2 weeks before the long weekend, Parkar & me discussed about this route and finalized the day-wise plan in just one sitting. Nothing else planned though. Parkar took around 5-7 warm-up rides across Bangalore during this time, and 2 days before the trip, we went for another 60 km+ warm up ride to Hennur Forest. I was relieved after going for this warm-up ride, because the sore muscles got recovered by the next day - just before the trip and, getting ready for a daily 80-90km ride was important.


<h3 id="section_1">Day 0: Finding the bus to Mangalore in heavy rains (with our bykes)</h3>
<p>
	<p>We did no prior bookings (buses and hotels) in advance since we were carrying bykes and things were not fully predictable. Weather forecast showed rains all along the route till next week. We packed our all our gears, dry fruits and other edibles, and left for Majestic bus stand. It started raining heavily just after 2 kms of start (around 8 PM). It seemed like the rain is not going to stop and we didn't want to negotiate with the last bus till Mangalore; so we wore our raincoat, <u>kept our mobile in our raincoat's pocket</u> and resumed. It was raining heavily. Risk apart, we always liked riding in the rains. At some places, half of the tires were submerged inside the logged water, but it was fun. This was third time I was riding in such heavy rain and so much of water.</p>
	<p>It took us around 30-45 mins to find, convince, negotiate with a bus conductor to allow to keep our bykes in the luggage. These were <a href="">KSRTC Airavat</a> multi-axle semi-sleeper buses. We kept the bykes in vertical position supported with the byke stand inside the luggage compartment.</p>
	<p>Inside the bus, Parkar's phone was stuck in a boot loop, and we couldn't do anything to stop it. It kept restarting the whole night. My phone was working fine, but the moment I put it in charging, it probably short circuited and touch sensor stopped responding. Both our phones had stopped working.
	While the bus left by 11:30 PM, I was also constantly worried about cycle getting damaged on the way, esp while crossing the ghats.</p>

<p>
Getting a good sleep in a semi-sleeper bus is tough, we took them because these buses have huge luggage space and they usually allow bykes. We got down at the Mangalore bus stand, put on our gears, and started the trip by 8 AM. This route was mostly highway - NH 66. We crossed many deltas, rivers as part of beautiful landscapes.
