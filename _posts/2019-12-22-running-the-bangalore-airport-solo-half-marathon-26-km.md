<p>
The Airport Run 2019 (third). This one was tougher than last year, probably because I weigh 5kg+ (planned weight gain) more since then, which I could clearly feel. They've dug a long part of the airport road, so the track is not as good now.

The shoes is the picture is now finally retired, which I used for 3 years and all the Airport runs as well. Atleast <b>2100 km</b> of running in these shoes overall.
So far I've been successful in running a half marathon (+ 5 km) airport run on last Sunday of every year for 3 consecutive years. I plan on continuing this. I ran today because of some plans on next Sunday (actual last)
