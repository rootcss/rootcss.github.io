Writing those 16-digits (well, mostly) card (Credit/Debit) number each time you make a payment online is painful, isn't it? Especially, if the payment fails because of network issues or wrong card details.

But, why can I save these card details only on selected websites? Why don't other websites just start saving those card details? Is it safe to allow a random website to store my card details? How can I trust these websites with my card details? What if any of these random websites gets hacked?

Well, That's where PCI DSS Compliance comes in the picture. A random website cannot just start saving your card information. Yes! they can, but it's unethical and illegal.
