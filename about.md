<p style="text-align:justify;"> Hi, I am <name title="Shekhar Singh aka. Chandrashekhar Singh aka. rootcss"><b>Shekhar</b></name>. I'm working as a <b>Data/Software Engineer</b> at <a target="_blank" href="https://getsimpl.com">Simpl</a> with awesome people, where we are trying to make people's life simpler :) Previously, I have worked as a <b>Software Engineer in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emc.com/">EMC</a></b> (now DELL-EMC) and have done sound research in <b>TUHH, Germany</b> and <b><a target="_blank" href="http://cdac.in/">CDAC</a>, Chennai</b>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In my leisure time, I spend most of my time doing <b>side-projects</b>, implementing my <b>ideas</b> and <b>R&amp;D</b>. Eventually, I end up writing some {code} or ^visualization^.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I'm a polyglot and love to work on Distributed Computing, Big Data Engineering, Data Science, Web Application Development, Open Source tools/technologies, Networks, Hacking, Security, Android. You can contact me @ <b>shekhar.singh[at]msn.com</b>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Apart from work, I love playing sports, going on trekking &amp; road trips. I believe, I cook really well and do many experiments in it. I'm a huge Hollywood fan, I hunt for classical movies and watch them :P </p>
